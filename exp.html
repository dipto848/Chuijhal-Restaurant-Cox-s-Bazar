<h3>How we started</h3><br/>
  <p font face="verdana">The computer is one of the best creations of man. It is the most refreshing result of science and innovation that has made our lives so simpler. Computers are getting ubiquitous as we can find computers from anywhere, like from homes, schools, universities, workplaces, research centers to libraries, exhibition halls, and even emergency clinics.
A computer is a machine that can store enormous measure of information and can carry out various responsibilities in a lot lesser time contrasted with people. It gathers contribution from users, processes it, and conveys the usual outcome as output.

The primary mechanical Computer was made by Charles Babbage. The significant parts of a computer are – Mouse, Keyboard, Central Processing Unit (CPU), and the Monitor.

In this day and age, people have gotten so subject to Computers that it is unimaginable for them to live without it. What makes Computers so significant is its use, productivity, and pure openness. The astonishing advantages of computers make it the most required innovation.

Computers are of incredible use in the field of Education. It assists instructors with planning introductions for workshops; students think it’s simple to work on their projects from their homes utilizing a computer. Every single money related exchange, representative record keeping, business forms are done through computers. Computers are utilized while directing clinical methods like X-rays, CT scans, MRI examine, and so forth. PCs are an aid to the defense office as they help identify approaching rockets, diagnosing bombs in this way help in sparing lives.

The computer is a superb endowment of science made by man to support humanity. Computers are administering the present reality, and these have certainly changed the lifestyle of individuals and the status of creating nations.</p>
  <h1>Our mission</h1>
  <p font face="verdana">Forests have a great floral diversity. There are large trees, creepers and climbers, grasses, bushes, shrubs and plants that grow in forests. Forests are also habitats to many wildlife species. A large variety of animals, birds, reptiles and insects live in forests.

In the forest you can hear the roaring of the lion, the trumpeting of the elephant, the chattering of monkeys and the sweet calls and songs of birds. You can see many colourful birds, many beautiful butterflies flitting around and many small insects and reptiles in the forest. For all these wildlife species the forest is their home.

These wild creatures live, feed, mate and raise families in the forest. There are large carnivorous animals like tigers, lions and leopards. There are other carnivorous mammals like hyenas, foxes and jackals, and birds like vultures, hawks and eagles that feed on carcasses in forests. Then, there are herbivorous creatures like the deer and elephant that depend on the trees and vegetation for their food. The herbivores also become food for the carnivores. The food chain is in balance with the carnivores and herbivores living in the forest. When forests are disturbed and wildlife killed by man, there is disequilibrium in the food chain that causes ecological disturbances.

Forests offer sustenance to many life forms including man. Man depends on forests for food and livelihood. Forests also maintain the hydrological cycle. Rainfall patterns are normal when forests are left undisturbed. Trees also help in holding the top soil which is fertile. When trees are cut off, the top soil gets washed away in rains and floods. This leads not only to silting of water bodies but also loss of soil fertility.

Deforestation is a hazard for ecosystems and the environment. Forests are a great natural wealth and should be protected.

Deforestation Paragraph 350 Words
When trees and vegetation in a forest are cleared out it is known as deforestation. The land thus obtained is then used for creating residential or industrial areas or for the practice of agriculture or for laying roads or railway tracks. In this process many developmental goals, as we understand development, are satisfied. But the ecosystem and the environment are damaged irreversibly due to the deforestation.

The trees and vegetation in a forest take long to grow. While it may take many years for trees to grow and for a forest to develop, it can be destroyed in a very short time due to the technology in man’s command and his uncontrolled greed and desire. Trees and forests play a very important role in our ecosystems. Forests have a great floral diversity that includes trees, creepers, climbers, grasses, bushes, shrubs and herbs.

A number of wildlife species such as mammals, birds, reptiles and insects live in forests. There are large animals like the elephant, rhinoceros and tiger, and smaller ones like the fox, jackal and antelope that live in forests. There are also a variety of birds that can be found in forests which may be endemic or native, or migratory ones that have flown in from distant lands. For instance, birds fly into India to save themselves the bitter Siberian winter. There are many varieties of snakes, butterflies and worms that also live in forests. All these wildlife species depend on the forests for their food.

When forests are cleared these species lose their homes and food. Thus we lose the wildlife diversity by cutting down forest trees. It is by deforestation that we have lost wildlife like the cheetah, and the lives of several wild species are endangered and threatened. We have to save our forests and the biodiversity that it supports by putting a stop to deforestation.

Forests provide food and livelihood for man too. Forests also maintain the hydrological cycle and climatic patterns on Earth. Global warming is also a fall out of deforestation. If we want to save our planet we must protect our forests.</p>
